# lein-pallet-fuz

A Leiningen plugin for deploying ring applications to the cloud via pulling from a private github repo using pallet. You configure it via your project.clj. Tested with EC2 and an Ubuntu instance.

## Usage

First things first, set up pallet with the service credentials it needs. Visit the [first-steps page](http://palletops.com/doc/first-steps/). In particular you'll need some service config in your `~/.pallet directory`. See the `lein pallet add-service` task. If you're deploying to EC2 you'll need your aws-key and aws-secret-key which you can find contained within the 'security credentials' section in the EC2 portal.

TODO setup up .pallet stuff... i.e. lein pallet add-service @

Put `[lein-pallet-fuz "0.1.0]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

    $ lein pallet-fuz setup

and

	$ lein pallet-fuz teardown


Consult the [sample-project.clj](https://github.com/jonpither/lein-pallet-fuz/blob/stable/sample-project.clj) file here. You'll need to setup github as to authorise using the ssh keypair you want to use. Github has the 'deployment key' feature exactly for this purpose.

You should also test your application localled with `lein ring server`.

## Limitations

This plugin is quite simple so if you want to do more with Pallet then you should probably just rip this code and do whatever. It could be possible in the future to make this plugin extensible but right now it isnt.
